## What is a Quartile?
> A quartile is a statistical term that describes a division of observations into four defined intervals based on the values of the data and how they compare to the entire set of observations.
## Why is a Quartile?
> The quartile measures the spread of values above and below the mean by dividing the distribution into four groups.
## Special Consideration
> If the datapoint for Q1 is farther away from the median than Q3 is from the median, then we can say that there is a greater dispersion among the smaller values of the dataset than among the larger values. The same logic applies if Q3 is farther away from Q2 than Q1 is from the median.

> Quartiles are used to calculate the interquartile range, which is a measure of variability around the median. The interquartile range is simply calculated as the difference between the first and third quartile: Q3â€“Q1. In effect, it is the range of the middle half of the data that shows how spread out the data is.
