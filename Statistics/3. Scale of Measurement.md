## Nominal
- Colors, labeled, name, gender\
**Example**:\
1: Red\
2: Blue\
3: Red\
**Explanation**:\
The numbers doesn't mean order, `Blue` is not necessarily better than `Red`. But the numbers just only show the label.
## Ordinal
- Rank, satisfaction survey, etc
- **Example**: 
  * Race
    1. 1st 
    2. 2nd
    3. 3rd
  * **Explanation**: The first rank means better than 2nd rank, but we can't say differences between 1st and 2nd same with differences between 2nd and 3rd. Imagine that:
    1. 1st : finish at 5:00:01 pm
    2. 2nd : finish at 5:00:02 pm
    3. 3rd : finish at 5:15:00 pm
## Interval
- Temperatures, Voltage
- **Example**:
  * Temperature
    Imagine we have data
    1. 30"C
    2. 60"C
    3. 47"C
  * **Explanation**: We can say 60"C more hot that 47"C and 30"C. We can also say that differences between 30"C and 60"C more larger that differences between 60"C and 47"C. But we can't say 60"C is twice hot than 30"C (doesn't make sense, why?)
## Ratio
- Height, Grades, Weight
